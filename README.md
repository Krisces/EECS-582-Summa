<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This application aims to empower users by providing a secure login/signup feature via Clerk and a user-friendly dashboard. Once logged in, users can add income and expenses, selecting a date range of up to one month to view their total income, total expenses, and net balance.

Key features include:

* Expense Categorization: Users can view expenses by category, represented visually with progress bars that fill as spending increases relative to total expenses.
* Data Visualization: A percentage chart displays spending habits across categories (e.g., groceries 60%, relationships 10%, gym 30%). Additionally, a bar chart contrasts total income and expenses over a selected month or across a year.
* Latest Expenses: Users can quickly access their most recent expenses.
* Category Management: Users can create categories with specific emojis and names, set optional budget amounts, and view usage against the budget. Clicking on a category leads to a detailed view of related expenses, with options to edit or delete expenses.
* Data Analytics: A dedicated tab will feature machine learning capabilities to predict spending habits and provide forecasts based on historical data. For instance, it will anticipate higher spending during the Christmas season, helping users save accordingly.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive budgeting tool that not only tracks expenses but also leverages data analytics to enhance financial planning.
